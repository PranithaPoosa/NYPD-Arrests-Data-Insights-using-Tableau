This project aims to demonstrate insights from NYPD Arrests(Historic) Data considered from years 2018-2022 using Tableau. <br>
The data is collected from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data for years 2018-2022 and stored in BigQuery.<br>
Some basic preprocessing steps were done on the columns like Perp_sex, arrest_boro, arrest_precinct etc., using Python and processed data is again stored in BigQuery. (Before running main.py, add the json file of your GCP service account)<br><br>
